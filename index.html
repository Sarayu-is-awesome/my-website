Potatos are food...so is chicken------ A potato flew around my room until you came in.... me is yummy!!!!!!!!! Potatoes are evil!!!!!
Potato is "spud"  "Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in amounts small enough to be negligible to human health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health."
"The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus)."
This is proof that potatoes and chicken are evil!!!!!
